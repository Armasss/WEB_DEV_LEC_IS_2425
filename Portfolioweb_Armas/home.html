        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> 
            My name is Mark Rainier Armas, and I am currently 20 years old. 
            I am a dedicated third-year student at the Technological University of Manila, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. 
            Throughout my studies, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages, including C++, C, and Java, 
            which have provided me with a solid foundation in software development and problem-solving skills.
        </p>

        <P>
            In addition to my programming knowledge, I have experience in prototyping applications using FIGMA, which gives me an idea on how to effectively design and visualize user interfaces. 
            This combination of technical skills and design understanding equips me to tackle diverse challenges in the field of information systems. 
            I am eager to apply my learning in practical settings and contribute to innovative projects.
        </P>
        <p>
            So far, I am not yet well-versed in the programming languages I use; I just have a foundational understanding of them. 
            However, I am eager to deepen my knowledge and enhance my skills through hands-on projects and practical applications. 
            I believe that continuous learning and practice will help me become more proficient, allowing me to tackle more complex challenges and contribute effectively to team projects in the future. 
            My goal is to build a strong expertise that will serve me well in my career in information systems.        
        </p>
