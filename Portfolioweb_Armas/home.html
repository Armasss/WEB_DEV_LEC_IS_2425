      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Mark Rainier Armas, and I am currently 20 years old. I am a <br>
        dedicated third-year student at the Technological University of Manila, <br>
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. Throughout my <br>
        studies, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages, <br>
        including C++, C, and Java, which have provided me with a solid <br>
        foundation in software development and problem-solving skills. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my programming knowledge, I have experience in <br>
        prototyping applications using FIGMA, which gives me an idea on how to <br>
        effectively design and visualize user interfaces. This combination of <br>
        technical skills and design understanding equips me to tackle diverse <br>
        challenges in the field of information systems. I am eager to apply my <br>
        learning in practical settings and contribute to innovative projects. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I am not yet well-versed in the programming languages I use; I <br>
        just have a foundational understanding of them. However, I am eager to <br>
        deepen my knowledge and enhance my skills through hands-on projects and <br>
        practical applications. I believe that continuous learning and practice <br>
        will help me become more proficient, allowing me to tackle more complex <br>
        challenges and contribute effectively to team projects in the future. My <br>
        goal is to build a strong expertise that will serve me well in my career <br>
        in information systems.
